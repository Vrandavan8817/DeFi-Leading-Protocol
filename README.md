DeFi Lending Protocol


Project Description
A decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol that allows users to deposit assets to earn interest or borrow assets by providing collateral. The protocol automatically manages interest rates based on supply and demand, and includes a liquidation mechanism for undercollateralized loans to ensure system solvency.

Project Vision
To create an accessible and transparent lending platform that removes traditional intermediaries while providing competitive yields for lenders and flexible borrowing options for borrowers. The protocol aims to democratize access to financial services and create new opportunities for capital efficiency in the blockchain ecosystem.

Key Features
Deposit assets to earn interest with dynamic APY rates
Borrow against collateral with customizable loan-to-value ratios
Automated liquidation mechanism to maintain system solvency
Governance token for protocol parameter adjustments
Transparent and immutable transaction history
Future Scope
Cross-chain lending capabilities
Integration with other DeFi protocols for yield optimization
Credit delegation allowing addresses to borrow on behalf of others
Flash loans for arbitrage and liquidation opportunities
Risk-adjusted interest rates based on collateral quality
Insurance fund to protect against black swan events
Technical Details
Smart Contracts
DeFiLendingProtocol.sol: Main contract handling deposits, borrows, and interest calculation
MockToken.sol: ERC20 token implementation for testing the protocol
Core Functions
deposit(): Users can deposit assets to earn interest
borrow(): Users can borrow against their collateral
repay(): Users can repay their loans with interest
getHealthFactor(): Calculates the health of a user's position
Architecture
The protocol uses a simplified interest rate model with a fixed base rate. The collateralization ratio is set at 75%, with liquidations triggered when positions fall below this threshold.

Installation
bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/defi-lending-protocol.git
cd defi-lending-protocol

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile
Deployment
Configure your environment variables:

PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
Deploy to Core Testnet 2:

bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network coreTestnet2
Testing
bash
# Run tests
npx hardhat test
Security Considerations
Smart contract audits are recommended before mainnet deployment
Interest rate models should be stress-tested
Liquidation mechanisms should be carefully reviewed
Oracle dependencies should be evaluated for manipulation risks
